    <h1>Favorite Comedy</h1>
    <p>My favorite comedy movie is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0838283/" target="_blank">Step Brothers</a> directed by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0570912/?ref_=tt_ov_dr" target="_blank">Adam McKay</a>.</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/media/rm123246080/tt0838283?ref_=tt_ov_i" target="_blank"><img src="http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTcwNzUzMjU1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTM0NDQ2MQ@@._V1_UX182_CR0,0,182,268_AL_.jpg" alt="Step Brothers Poster"/></a></p>
    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>In short, I just find this a hilarious movie. It has a very immature humor that can appeal to almost everyone. It also has a creative mix of both slapstick comedy and humorous dialogue. The principle cast members. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002071/?ref_=tt_cl_t1" target="_blank">Will Ferrell</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000604/?ref_=tt_cl_t2" target="_blank">John C. Reilly</a>, do an incredible job of playing 2 man-children who don't want to grow or accept change in their lives. Both characters also convey a sense of actual care towards their respective parents, and vice versa. It feels like a real family, from the ever popular and interesting brother and his proclaimed perfect family, to the uptight therapist that falls for somebody a little more childish. The story is about 2 parents falling in love. getting married, and then forcing their 2 30-something year old sons to live together and accept the big change in their lives. It is one of my favorite movies.</p>
    <h3>Favorite Drama</h3>
    <p>My favorite drama movie is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161/" target="_blank">The Shawashank Redemption</a>.</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/media/rm3597327872/tt0111161?ref_=tt_ov_i"><img src="http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BODU4MjU4NjIwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDU2MjEyMDE@._V1_UX182_CR0,0,182,268_AL_.jpg" alt="The Shawshank Redemption Poster"/></a></p>
    <h3>Why?</h3>
    <p>The <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000151/?ref_=tt_cl_t2" target="_blank">Shawshank Redemption</a> has something fore eveyone. It has actiojn when Andy is trying to escape the sisters, comedy when Andy does everyone's taxes, and a happy ending for the good guys. The movie is the story of Andy Dufresne, played by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000209/?ref_=tt_cl_t1>" target="_blank"> Tim Robbin </a>. Andy has been wrongly convicted of his wife's murder and has been sent to jail because of it. He makes several friends while in Shawshank Penitetiary, chiefly Red, played by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000151/?ref_=tt_cl_t2" target="_blank">Morgan Freeman</a>. However, prison life does not suite Andy and he eventually tunnels his way to freedom. All the actors do an incredible job, really convincing the audience of their conviction to their lives. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000209/?ref_=tt_cl_t1" target="_blank">Tim Robbins</a> especially conveys an inmates thoughts excellently. When Andy finally escapes from prison, Robbins' acting is amazing, perectly showing a man experiencing something he has not experienced in a long time. The relationship between the warden and Andy is also fascinating. Here we see the warden, whose job it is to keep lawbreakers in line, breaking several laws for his own personal gain. The prisoners, on the contrary, all seem to be good men. This switch of morality really helps the audience connect with the inmates without feeling like the protagonists and prisoners should be in prison.</p>
    <h4>Best Action Movie</h4>
    <p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/media/rm2525146112/tt0095016?ref_=tt_ov_i" target="_blank"><img src="http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTY4ODM0OTc2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzE0MTk3OA@@._V1_UX182_CR0,0,182,268_AL_.jpg" alt="Die Hard Poster"/></a></p>
    <p>My favorite action movie is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095016/" target="_blank">Die Hard</a>.</p>
    <h4>Why?</h4>
    <p>Die Hard is fantastic. The special effects especially. The explosions are very realistic. The sound of each concussion wave as fire rushes into the sky is well designed, probably due to the reliance on practical effects. These effects translate to the gunshots to. The use of explosive squibd to show blood splatters are ingenious. The movie does a great job of not holding any punches. It shows everything from the brutal slaughter of police officers to the headshots of civilians, the movie never lasts on these moments. It treats them like they would be treated in real life, as an event to be mouyrned after the chaos is over. The is generic, but the principle cast member does a perfect job spicing up the sad and chaotic plot with punches of comedy. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000246/?ref_=tt_cl_t1" target="_blank">Bruce Willis plays Office John McLean, a New York cop visiting his wife in Los Angeles. He goes and suprises her at her work, however terrorists suddenly overtake the building and begin to cut into the building's safe. John must fight to save his wife, will being helped and hindered by the authorities outside, while causing minimal collateral damage. Willis uses this plot as a way to basically plug in punchlines, creating many different one-liners. The comedy is a good break from the action and helps establish McLean as a bit of an oddjob, considering he can not take anything serious in such a crazy event. The movie single-handedly made Bruce Willis' career and launched a multi-million dollar franchise.</a></p>
