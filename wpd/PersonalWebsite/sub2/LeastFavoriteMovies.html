    <p> The above links demonstrate a basic navigational structure using an unordered list styled with CSS. Use this as a starting point and modify the properties to produce your own unique look. If you require flyout menus, create your own using a Spry menu, a menu widget from Adobe's Exchange or a variety of other javascript or CSS solutions.</p>
    <p>If you would like the navigation along the top, simply move the ul.nav to the top of the page and recreate the styling.</p>

    <h1>Least Favorite Comedy</h1>
    <p>The worst comedy movie I have ever seen has got to be <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0810913/" target="_blank">Jack and Jill</a>.</p>
    <p><a href="http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BNjczMTU5OTUyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODEzNjc3Ng@@._V1_UX182_CR0,0,182,268_AL_.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BNjczMTU5OTUyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODEzNjc3Ng@@._V1_UX182_CR0,0,182,268_AL_.jpg" alt="Jack and Jill Poster"/></a></p>
    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>It is so bad. Really, really just a terrible movie. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001191/?ref_=tt_cl_t1" target="_blank">Adam Sandler</a> plays Jack and his sister, Jill. Wait, what?! Adam Sandler playing 2 characters! How did this movie fail? Because it is an abomination. It is terrible. Nothing in this movie is worth anything. All the comedy is is constant fart jokes and fat jokes. Sandler, suprisingly enough, CAN NOT PLAY A WOMAN WELL. Shocking right? He just acts like an idiot in drag. </p>
    <h3>Least Favorite Drama Movie</h3>
    <p>My least favorite drama movie is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3203616/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">The Cobbler</a> directed by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0565336/?ref_=tt_ov_dr">Tom McCarthy.</a></p>
    <p><a href="http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTgzMjQ2OTQ0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTc2MTI2NDE@._V1_UX182_CR0,0,182,268_AL_.jpg"><img src="http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTgzMjQ2OTQ0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTc2MTI2NDE@._V1_UX182_CR0,0,182,268_AL_.jpg" alt="The Cobbler Poster"/></a></p>
    <p>Please don't make me talk about this movie. I don't want to think about the terrible performances by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001191/?ref_=tt_cl_t7">Adam Sandler</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000114/?ref_=tt_cl_t11">Steve Buscemi</a>, and horrible cameo ny <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000163/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Dustin Hoffman</a>. Adam Sandler plays a cobbler. He discovers that using a magical manual shoe-repairing wheel he can transform into that person by wearing his or her shoes. It is terrible. Don't watch this movie. It will make you want to find Adam Sandler and yell at him for making such an abomination. It is sad to see that Sandler has begun to drag down Steve Buscemi into horribleness. The acting is bad, the story is bad, the effects are terrible, and the plot twist is obvious. I cannot say enough bad things about this movie.</p>
    <h4>Internet Explorer Conditional Comments</h4>
    <p>These liquid layouts contain an Internet Explorer Conditional Comment (IECC) to correct two issues. </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Browsers are inconsistent in the way they round div sizes in percent-based layouts. If the browser must render a number like 144.5px or 564.5px, they have to round it to the nearest whole number. Safari and Opera round down, Internet Explorer rounds up and Firefox rounds one column up and one down filling the container completely. These rounding issues can cause inconsistencies in some layouts. In this IECC there is a 1px negative margin to fix IE. You may move it to any of the columns (and on either the left or right) to suit your layout needs.</li>
      <li>The zoom property was added to the anchor within the navigation list since, in some cases, extra white space will be rendered in IE6 and IE7. Zoom gives IE its proprietary hasLayout property to fix this issue.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Backgrounds</h4>
    <p>By nature, the background color on any div will only show for the length of the content. This means if you're using a background color or border to create the look of a side column, it won't extend all the way to the footer but will stop when the content ends. If the .content div will always contain more content, you can place a border on the .content div to divide it from the column.</p>
